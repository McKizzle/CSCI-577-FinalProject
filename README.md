CSCI 577 Final Project
======================

## Potential Ideas
The ideas that I'm listing are from the __["Suggestions for Student Research Projects"](http://physics.clarku.edu/sip/projects.html "Project Ideas Page")__ page. 

  - F. Cecconi, R. Livi, and A. Politti, "Fuzzy transition region in a one-dimensional coupled-stable-map lattice," Phys. Rev. E 57, 2703 (1998). 
  - Bing-Hong Wang, Yvonne-Roamy Kwong, and Pak-Ming Hui, "Statistical mechanical approach to Fukui-Ishibashi traffic flow models," Phys. Rev. E 57, 2568 (1998). 
  - G. Berkolaiko and S. Havlin, "Number of distinct sites visited by Levy flights injected into a d-dimensional lattice," Phys. Rev. E 57, 2549 (1998). __This one is interesting but may not be relative to the class__
  - Maxim Vergeles, Pawel Keblinski, Joel Koplik, and Jayanth R. Banavar, "Stokes drag and lubrication flows: A molecular dynamics study," Phys. Rev. E 53, 4852 (1996). 
  - Kai Nagel, "Particle hopping models and traffic flow theory," Phys. Rev. E 53, 4655 (1996). __Sounds like fun!__
